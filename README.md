## Project Overview

Welcome to Vita-Tari, a remarkable game console project developed by a talented team of engineers. This project showcases our dedication, skill, and passion for creating a unique gaming experience using ARM Cortex M3 assembly language. üöÄ

## Project Description

The Vita-Tari game console is an ambitious venture where we built everything from the ground up, utilizing only ARM technologies. From initializing the TFT screen to setting up the IO buttons, every aspect of the console was meticulously crafted in ARM assembly.

### Games Developed

   - Engaging gameplay with a scoring system.

2. **Space Invaders:**
   - Dual-level challenge.
   - First level: Eliminate a legion of 18 enemies; each enemy takes two hits.
   - Enemies fire back based on player position in each column.
